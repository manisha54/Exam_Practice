   /* Suppose you need to create a program to create a circle and color it. You can create two methods to solve this problem:

    -a method to draw the circle
    -a method to color the circle
    Dividing a complex problem into smaller chunks makes your program easy to understand and reusable.

    In Java, there are two types of methods:

    User-defined Methods: We can create our own method based on our requirements.
    Standard Library Methods: These are built-in methods in Java that are available to use.*/
