package Methods;

public class StandardLibrary {

    }
}


/* sqrt() is the method of main class. It return  square root of a number.
adv:
1. Code reusability
    we can write a method  once, and use it multiple times. We dnt need to wtrite code again and again.

2. Method make code more readable and easier to debug.
